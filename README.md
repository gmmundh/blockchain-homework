Case Study

CoinSquare - Case Study

CoinSquare is Canada’s premier cryptocurrency trading platform for trading Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and other digital currencies.
Coinsquare now serves 100,000+ customers, and is set to expand globally by licensing and white labeling its technology to proven operators in markets around the world. Coinsquare was also named the fastest growing and send most sought-after startup in Canada according to LinkedIn’s Top Startups list.
Coinsquare has also previously dealt in precious metals trading, but it shuttered this service in 2018 and transitioned to being a cryptocurrency exchange only. This new expansion into ATMs allows the company to once again diversify its offerings


Concept
CoinSquare has been built with the concept of being accessible for everyone. Their marketing slogan is “Built for the World” with further expanding to “Everyone in the world deserves a safe, easy to use way to access digital currency markets. Their mission is to create a regulated and open financial platform for the world by leveraging blockchain technology.

Technology
CoinSquare has been built with in-house proprietary technology which is both SSL and 2FA technology enabled with a 95% cold storage policy on all digital currency. Their systems have been stress tested and DDOS tested. 

CoinSqaure ATMs
In July 2019, CoinSquare tool a controlling investment in Just Cash a Crypto ATM Company j that creates software to convert regular ATMs in Crypto ATMs.
Just Cash operates software that can allow everyday ATMs to sell crypto assets to customers directly, without the need for new hardware, additional capital investments by the ATM operator or a mobile application by the user to purchase cryptocurrency through the ATM.
CoinSquare has claimed there is an existing network of 250,000 non-banking ATMs in the United States. Just Cash has developed a solution to convert those machines into cryptocurrency ATMs, to be able to both buy and sell crypto through those machines.  In the long term they expect to have this software in 250,000 machines. A pretty long short in my view however if they can even capture 10-20% of the market that would drastically increase adoption in cryptocurrency.
CoinSquare in Europe
Coinsquare took its first trip outside its Canadian base to extend its operations to Europe in Nov  2018, the exchange enabled euro deposits and trading, in what the company saw as a promising market for future expansion.
CoinSquare Mining
Coin Square has its own mining operation with its own mining operation with 2 MW of power and 1700 mining units in operation.
CoinSquare Fees
CoinSquare has one of the lowest fees in the industry with 0.1% if you are the market maker, and 0.2% if you are the market taker. This is significantly lower than some other competitors who takes fees as high as 2%.  However CoinSquare does have fees for withdrawal and funding which depends on the amount of money being taken.
